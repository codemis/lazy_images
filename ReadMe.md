#Lazy Images
iOS 6 Update of Apple sample code Lazy Table Images.  Apple's Description states:

This sample demonstrates a multi-stage approach to loading and displaying a 
UITableView.  It displays the top paid iPhone apps on Apple's App Store.

It begins by loading the relevant text from the RSS feed so the table can load
as quickly as possible, then downloads the app images for each row asynchronously
so the UI is more responsive.
